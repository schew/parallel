For the first part, I kept the data length size as 512*512*128 and varied the filter size from 1 to 1024. The loop in the main method was changed to iterate from i=1 instead of i=16 to get 1, 2, 4, and 8. I ran filter.cpp on the g++ compiler 20 times and pushed the output into a txt file and transferred the data to an excel spreadsheet in order to perform calculations and plot the runtime. The threads, data_length, and filter_length were individually changed, recompiled using the Makefile, and run for each trial for the other parts.


The source folder includes a Makefile, filter.cpp, and filter_optimized.cpp, which is the optimized version of filter.
filter.cpp contains the code used to run the tests and the implementation of parallel data first and parallel filter first.
filter_optimized.cpp contains an optimized version of the parallel data first and parallel filter first implementations from filter.cpp
Makefile will compile and clean the executables
